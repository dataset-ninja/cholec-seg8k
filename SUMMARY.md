**CholecSeg8k: A Semantic Segmentation Dataset for Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy Based on Cholec80** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the medical industry. 

The dataset consists of 8080 images with 53690 labeled objects belonging to 13 different classes including *liver*, *black background*, *fat*, and other: *abdominal wall*, *gallbladder*, *grasper*, *gastrointestinal tract*, *l-hook electrocautery*, *connective tissue*, *blood*, *hepatic vein*, *cystic duct*, and *liver ligament*.

Images in the CholecSeg8k dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Additionally, every image marked with its ***video id*** and ***sequence*** tags. The dataset was released in 2020 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">National University, Taiwan</span>.
